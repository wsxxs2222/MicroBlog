brain storm and plan project outcome and structure

init npm and install express
create the project structure

basic formats for the homepage and post partial (ejs files)
set up server (index.js)
connect css to ejs files (set the directory of static files)
render ejs files in the server (can use app.set to change the default views folder)
add partial post to the ejs file (<%-include%>)
iterate all the posts and pass them as parameters to add multiple post partials

TODO
create, update, delete posts
upload images
polish css
